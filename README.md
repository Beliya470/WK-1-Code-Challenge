# Week 1 Code Challenge

This repository contains the solutions to the Week 1 Code Challenge, which includes three toy problems implemented in JavaScript.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade:
- A > 79
- B - 60 to 79
- C - 59 to 49
- D - 40 to 49
- E - less than 40

### Challenge 2: Speed Detector

Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car. If the speed is less than 70, it should print "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print "License suspended".

### Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator

Write a program to calculate an individual's Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. The program should calculate the payee (i.e., Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary.

NB: Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the links below.

## Project Setup

To run the code, ensure you have Node.js installed. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Install the dependencies using the following command:


Each challenge has its own JavaScript file, and you can run them individually using the `node` command followed by the filename. For example:


Make sure to input the required values or modify the code as needed to test different scenarios.
